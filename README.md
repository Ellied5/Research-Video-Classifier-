This project utilizes deep learning techniques such as CNNs, LSTMs, ConvLSTMs, and Autoencoders to analyze unmarked videos of mice post spinal cord injuries. The goal of this project is to assist researchers at the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis with sorting through the massive amounts of video data in order to draw accurate and timely conclusions.
